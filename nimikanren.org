I stumbled across Dr. Will Byrd's work with relational logic programming this
morning (17 February 2015). Fueled by sleep deprivation, caffeine, and
dissatisfaction with my life, I have decided to learn miniKanren, DSLs, and Nim
all in one go. The result will (hopefully) be an implementation of miniKanren,
as described in Dr. Byrd's dissertation on the subject, in Nim. First I have to
finish reading (and understanding) said dissertation. Pieces of an
implementation will be added to this file and the associated repository.

* Package for Nimble.

  The intent of the project is for it to be a library, so we have to construct
  a .nimble file to specify said library.

  The only part of the ~[Package]~ section that changes is the version number.

  #+NAME: nimikanren.nimble-package
  #+BEGIN_SRC text
    [Package]
    name        = "nimikanren"
    version     = "0.1.0"
    author      = "Jacob MacDonald"
    description = "Use miniKanren relational programming in Nim."
    license     = "Unlicense"
  #+END_SRC

  The dependencies should not have to change that much. Just to be safe,
  nimiKanren depends on the development version of Nim, which I use.

  #+NAME: nimikanren.nimble-deps
  #+BEGIN_SRC text
    [Deps]
    Requires: "nim >= 0.10.3"
